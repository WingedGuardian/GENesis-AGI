"""The corpus cache holds real commands, so its file mode is a security control.

``scripts/replay_guard_corpus.py`` caches every distinct Bash command this
install has ever run, verbatim, so it can replay them through a guard. That
file demonstrably contains secrets passed in argv (an inline ``SSHPASS=`` was
found in it), which is why it is written 0600 and lives outside the repo.

The mode was being requested in a way that silently did not apply. ``os.open``
honours its mode argument ONLY on the call that actually creates the file, so a
``--rebuild`` over a cache already sitting at 0644 rewrote the secrets into a
world-readable inode — while the confirmation line printed ``(mode 0600)``,
because that string was hard-coded rather than measured. The tightening helper
existed but was wired only to the LOAD path, never the rebuild path.

Both halves are locked here: the inode is tightened on rebuild, and the mode
the tool announces is read back off the file rather than asserted.
