# OOM event capture for scripts/tmp_watchgod.sh — SOURCED by it, never run.
# Moved here verbatim from tmp_watchgod.sh (watchgod v2) to keep the daemon

# ── OOM event capture (best-effort, cgroup v2) ───────────────
# A cgroup OOM kill silently collapses a CC session (tmux `exec claude` → claude
# is reaped → the last pane dies → the session ends) and leaves no durable trace:
# the kernel dmesg ring cycles and the kernel journal is usually unreadable from
# inside the container. This samples the container cgroup's CUMULATIVE oom_kill
# counter each poll and, on a NEW kill since the daemon started, records a
# timestamped snapshot (memory + top-RSS processes) and pages once. Read-only —
# it never kills or reclaims anything. Degrades to a no-op when the cgroup-v2
# interface file is absent/unreadable (older layouts / non-cgroup2 hosts).

# Attribution reads the systemd journal because the killer cgroup is usually a
# TRANSIENT scope, deleted with its job — every surviving cgroup shows the kill
# only as an inherited aggregate (measured: local=0 at every level) — while the
# journal names the unit and outlives the scope. The query window is a CURSOR:
# each successful read advances a durable epoch marker, and the next read asks
# only for lines SINCE it. That is what keeps attribution honest during a
# thrashing contained job: without it, a contained kill's line from the
# PREVIOUS increment still inside a fixed lookback could account for a NEW
# kill that left no line of its own (a non-main process dying inside a
# surviving scope writes no unit-failure line) and silence a page. A missing
# cursor (first run) falls back to a short lookback computed from the LIVE
# poll interval; a failed query does not advance the cursor. Every failure

    #                 the journal names the victim unit, and a container-limit
    #                 kill can victimise a contained child scope)
    #   deficit     — kills we already paged for whose journal records have not
    #                 been seen yet. systemd's record of a unit failure can be
    #                 emitted AFTER the poll that observed the counter
    #                 increment, and the record's timestamp is PID 1's EMISSION
    #                 time (measured on the live journal, #1790 audit) — so NO
    #                 time window can exclude a late record from the next
    #                 kill's batch. The only sound correlation is
    #                 reconciliation: records returned by a query first retire
    #                 the owed deficit, and only the REST may account for the
    #                 current delta. A late record can therefore never cover a

    #                 record (a non-main process dying inside a surviving
    #                 scope) leaves a deficit nothing can retire; it expires
    #                 after 20 poll intervals so contained kills are not
    #                 spuriously paged forever. Residue, accepted: a journald
    #                 outage LONGER than the TTL, ending with a query whose
    #                 backlogged records exactly equal deficit+n, can

        # paged and cleared drain, its re-anchor silently failed, and the kill
        # after that -- a genuine one whose own record was never written -- was
        # accounted for by the first kill's record, still inside the fallback
        # window, and suppressed. Two kills, one page. Clear drain only when the
        # cursor is verifiably on disk.
        # BOTH DIRECTIONS. `drain` means "the cursor is not anchored", so the
        # cursor decides it -- clearing it on success while never SETTING it left
        # the inverse open, and the inverse is reachable from the ordinary
        # drain=0 state: a re-anchor that cannot persist deletes the cursor
        # (:549) and leaves drain=0 behind, so the next query falls back to the
        # relative window and re-reads the record this tick just counted.
        # MEASURED from `4:0:0:0:0` with the cursor path unwritable: a contained
        # kill, then a real kill that wrote no record of its own -- TWO kills,
        # ZERO pages. Setting drain from the cursor closes it in one place
        # rather than at each site that can fail to write.
        # Clearing needs BOTH: the query succeeded AND the cursor on disk is
        # anchored. The anchored check alone is syntax -- a stale file from a
        # dead epoch passes it -- and on a failed query nothing re-anchored, so
