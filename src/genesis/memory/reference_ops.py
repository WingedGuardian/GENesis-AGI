"""Shared reference-store domain operations.

Neutral home for reference-store logic used by BOTH the MCP tool layer
(``genesis.mcp.memory.knowledge``) and the dashboard route layer
(``genesis.dashboard.routes.references``). Keeping it here avoids the
presentation layer importing the MCP tool module (wrong direction) and
gives a single source of truth for:

- the reference ``project_type`` + valid ``kind`` set,
- parsing a stored reference ``body`` back into its description / value
  (the inverse of the ``_format_reference_body`` formatters), and
- the delete sequence (SQLite row + FTS + Qdrant point across both
  collections).

Body shape (produced identically by the ``reference_store`` MCP tool and
the extraction-job formatter)::

    [reference.{kind}] {identifier}

    {description}

    Value: {value}
    Tags: a, b            # optional
    Captured: via=... ...  # optional

``parse_reference_body`` is the security boundary for the dashboard: the
list/search/detail views must render ONLY the parsed ``description`` (never
the raw body), and the reveal endpoint returns ONLY the parsed ``value``.
It fails CLOSED — if the canonical ``\\n\\nValue: `` marker is absent the
value can't be located, so both fields come back empty rather than risk
leaking an unparsed secret into a non-reveal payload.
